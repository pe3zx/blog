      <p>According to my session for <a href="https://missconf.github.io/SP5.html">#MiSSConf(SP5)</a>, I decided to find some well-known case as an example and it will be used to analyze with <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> for pre and post-incident assessment. One of the most well-known security incident cases I picked is relating to the heist of Government Savings Bank in Thailand 2016 in which I found many interesting points with the malware. In this post, I will briefly explain those points as a note for myself and a teaser for my talk.</p>

<p>On the first week of August 2016, many headlines published about a security incident with one of a financial institution in Thailand, Government Savings Bank or GSB. The incident involved the use of unknown malware with many ATMs around the country to forcefully dispense the money.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/08/ripper_atm_malwarea.html">the analysis by FireEye</a>, they discovered a piece of malware uploaded to VirusTotal by an IP address in Thailand. It was uploaded a couple of minutes before the media reports about the heist. The analysis gives malware the name &ldquo;RIPPER&rdquo;. The original of MD5 which packed by UPX is <code>15632224b7e5ca0ccb0a042daf2adc13</code>.</p>
<p>Back in today, <a href="https://www.thaicert.or.th/downloads/files/A_Threat_Actor_Encyclopedia.pdf">Threat Group Cards: A Threat Actor Encyclopedia</a> from ThaiCERT points out that the group responsible for the attack is <strong>Cobalt Group</strong>. By the way, there&rsquo;s no detail about Cobalt Group and ATM RIPPER malware as much as I can find on the Internet. So my big question is, how can they attribute the attack to the threat actor group?</p>
<p>I decided to play a little bit with the malware sample by searching malware with the same attributes. In order to do that, I used the YARA rule posted by sadfud on KernelMode.info to find other samples with Hybrid-Analysis&rsquo;s &ldquo;YARA search&rdquo; feature.</p>
<p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QooFWmNP-f0/XRTFvzuvd4I/AAAAAAAATG4/rO-oXD-QCooxs5MklQUQ9c7xoV-cOJQcACLcBGAs/s1600/APT-based%2BSecurity%2BAssessment%2Band%2BDetection%2B%25281%2529.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As seen in the picture above, the oldest submission is the one from August 29, 2016, done after FireEye&rsquo;s analysis. The malware is identified as &ldquo;Malware.STk.Generic&rdquo; type. There&rsquo;s no older sample than that. We can infer that the malware hasn&rsquo;t been used before. More recent versions were also discovered, they were identified as &ldquo;Backdoor.ATMripper&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any access to private threat intelligence services except <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/autofocus">Autofocus from Palo Alto Networks</a> which also shows the same result. It may have more information and more effective way to find other samples older than that.</p>
<p>NCR published their advisory which explained that the malicious actor may breach internal bank network to install the malware. Later information by the Royal Thai Police force was mentioning about a suspicious group of European/Russian guys who probably behind the attack. Given these facts, I tried to find threat actor groups whose behaviors similar to what reported with the attack. Based on <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/">Groups section of MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a>, there are only two threat actors who have similar attributes from the facts.</p>

<p>This conclusion might be wrong because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>. But at least we have a list of TTPs we can use for compromised assessment (post-incident assessment).</p>
